## Hello! I'm your Personal Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG) Assistant!
This app is intended to illustrate how you can add relevant knowledge to an otherwise basic LLM Chat.  

Find a Doc with some information in it that an LLM wouldn't normally have. 
Before uploading the Doc, ask a question about some of the contents of the materials.
Upload the Docs and ask the same question again.  With the new context, the LLM can give more informed answers.

How do you do this in your applications?  You need a Vector database, AstraDB is one of the best.
